                <h3 class='subtitle'>There's plenty to choose from.</h3>
                <p class='content'>It's tempting to start looking ahead to 2020 now that we know it'll have Vampire: The
                    Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 in it, and possibly Cyberpunk 2077 as well. Maybe. But there are still over
                    nine
                    months of 2019 to go, so let's not get ahead of ourselves.

                    This year still has heavy hitters like Doom Eternal, Dying Light 2, Control, and Total War: Three
                    Kingdoms to look forward to, as well as long-awaited PC ports like Journey and the Master Chief
                    Collection. Indie games like Hollow Knight: Silksong, Untitled Goose Game, and Witchbrook have the
                    potential to shake things up, and I only just remembered while writing this sentence that Wasteland
                    3 is
                    coming too.

                    And that's just scratching the surface. What unreleased game of 2019 are you most looking forward
                    to?

                <p class='content'>After years of rumors and leaked mockup images, it's finally happening: Steam's
                    library
                    is getting a new look. This isn't a full-on redesign of Steam in its entirety, so the store and
                    other
                    parts of the interface aren't changing as far as we know. In its keynote at GDC on Thursday, Valve
                    showed off the new library view, highlighting a redesigned page with large game thumbnails and more
                    categorization around what's going on with your games.

                <h3 class='subtitle'>The best gaming keyboard you can find anywhere, at prices that won't boil your
                    brain.
                </h3>
                <p class='content'>The market for gaming peripherals has been absolutely flooded in the last few years
                    at
                    both ends, both with really high end, excellent gear and products of much more dubious quality, so
                    picking out the best gaming keyboard can be a real hassle. Gone are the days when picking a decent
                    mechanical board with your favorite Cherry switches was the work of a few minutes; not only does
                    Cherry
                    have a growing number of increasingly prolific competitors, but the boards themselves are becoming
                    more
                    and more crammed full of features and gimmicks. Worry not, though, we've tested tens of boards from
                    a
                    massive array of manufacturers to separate the wheat from the chaff.

                    excited.</h3>
                <p class='content'>The first Apex Legends battle pass went live today, kicking off the battle royale
                    game’s
                    first season—Wild Frontier. Battle passes like this are familiar territory for “live” battle royale
                    games like Fortnite and PUBG. You're basically buying a 90-day progress bar, and along with it some
                    tangible goals and rewards. While there are tons of players who would play Apex Legends or the like
                    without an added incentive, it’s an extra push for players interested in cosmetic updates and new
                    loot.

                </h2>
                <h3 class='subtitle'>We saw a thirty minute demo and talked to the creators raising Bloodlines from the
                    dead.</h3>
                <p class='content'>November of 2004 was a monumental month for games. Half-Life 2, Halo 2, and Metal
                    Gear
                    Solid 3 were all released to critical acclaim and massive commercial success. And crushed in among
                    those
                    blockbusters was Troika's RPG Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines. Due to a contract with Valve
                    involving
                    use of the Source Engine, Bloodlines couldn't be released ahead of Half-Life 2, and publisher
                    Activision
                    was unwilling to push the release date into 2005. And so, Bloodlines came out that same month,
                    forced to
                    compete with those three huge November releases.

                <h2 class='titles'>Cyberpunk 2077, and CD Projekt's next 'AAA RPG,' will both be out by 2021</h2>
                <h3 class='subtitle'>That's right, two games—both of them big RPGs.</h3>
                <p class='content'>CD Projekt's big thing right now is Cyberpunk 2077, but in case you'd forgotten, it's
                    working on another major RPG too. And even though we have no idea what that second game is at this
                    point, it's actually scheduled to be out pretty soon: The company said in a recent forum post that
                    the
                    plan is to have it (and Cyberpunk) released by 2021.

                    The original post is in Polish, and so the standard Google translation mangling applies, but this is
                    what it says after we run it through the machine: "As for the strategy of the CD Projekt Capital
                    Group
                    for the years 2016-2021, its plans for the release of the second AAA game until 2021 remain
                    unchanged.
                    We are currently focusing on the production and promotion of Cyberpunk, so we do not want to comment
                    on
                    further projects."

                                world games able to leverage the power of modern gaming systems to create environments

                                extraordinary detail and scope. The bogs of Velen are a moody aperitif that primes you

                                the
                                bustle of Novigrad and the sweeping forests of the nordic Skellige region—one of the
                                most

                            <p>You can spend hours sailing around those islands, stumbling upon quests, breaking curses,

                                monsters and playing Gwent with rowdy locals. The Witcher 3’s towns are noisy, bustling
                                places
                                that make other open world towns seem lifeless by comparison. It’s a pleasure to simply

                            <p>The cities are smaller and the plot is nonsense, but few games can match the excitement
                                of
                                smashing a port. You crack the walls open from the ocean with cannon fire before

                                freerunning through the shattered battlements, hunting the commander with a brace of

                                pistols. It’s exactly the sort of action that open worlds do brilliantly. Top storms,
